# dynamicFormantDataset

This dataset contains the formant contours of 360 vowels (12 speakers × 10 words × 3 repetitions) that were collected in Glasgow to study the effect of a morphologically-conditioned vowel alternation (stemming from the so-called *Scottish Vowel Length Rule* – see e.g. Ferragne, 2020) on formant trajectories. These vowels occur in minimal pairs like *tide-tied*; the heteromorphemic [d] in the second word causes the preceding vowel to lengthen and to display a different formant pattern from the monomorphemic item.

This tutorial shows how to analyse formant trajectories with R: https://www.emmanuelferragne.com/post/formant-dynamics/
